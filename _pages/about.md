Medillustrator: Improving Retrospective Learning in Physicians‚Äô Continuous Medical Education via Multimodal Diagnostic Data Alignment and Representation

Yuansong Xu, Jiahe Dong, Yijie Fan, **Yuheng Shao**, Chang Jiang, Lixia Jin, Yuanwu Cao, Quan Li

[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15593)

We introduce Medillustrator, a visual analytics system crafted to facilitate novice physicians‚Äô retrospective learning. Our structured approach enables novice physicians to explore and review research cases at an overview level and analyze specific cases with consistent alignment of multimodal and reference data. Furthermore, physicians can record and review analyzed results to facilitate further retrospection.
